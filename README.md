# algo-tradegator

This project is a collaboration between a number of cohort members of a FinTech Bootcamp through Monash Uni (Australia).  What we're attempting to build is an Algorithmic Trader which incorporates a number of signals (indicators and other inputs) into which a Machine Learning Model is created and trained.  Using the ML model we create, trades can be made based on what the model predicts.  Thus the name for our repo: algo-tradegotor :D
